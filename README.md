# 3DiCMS [WIP]

This cms made in php and javascript, allows you to generate iframes and qrcodes that lead to 3d models that can be instantiated with AR technology.

It means that, you can create a ecommerce, and put a qrcode that if a customer scans with the phone, he can instantiate the product in front of him with Augmented reality technology, without downloading anything!

WORK IN PROGRESS.
